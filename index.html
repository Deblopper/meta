			<h3>About Deb:</h3>
			<p><s>I'd rather put a bona-fide <b>About Me</b> when I have one.</s></p>
			<p><s>For now, over the past couple of hours' struggle and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/deblopper/posts/10151666113594188">constipated writers' block</a>, the only fact that I can apprehend &mdash; <em>HTML-spewing &amp; self-introspection doesn't quite go hand-in-hand</em>.</s></p>
			<hr />
			<p>I recall my father apprehending that I'll end up in jails or a mental-asylum, for sure, before I'd cross my teens &mdash; and that was before I had even been on the verge of my teens. As a word from a person with the insights which he has, it's most likely to manifest in all possible parallel Universes &mdash; but this one.</p>
			<p>Against all odds, the validity of that prophecy has voided long back. I've dashed my way through it, unhindered, and I'm not done yet...</p>
			<p>I still defy destiny, meddle monsters, pursue patterns &amp; write "About Me" without adjectives!</p>
